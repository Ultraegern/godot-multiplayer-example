A minimal idiomatic example of the Godot 4 high-level multiplayer api, using a dedicated server architecture  

# Features  
* Easily switch between `ENet`, `WebSocket` or `WebSocketSecure` networking backends  
* Abstract class `NetworkManager` for easy use in your own projects  
* `Creative Commons Zero` license so you can do what ever you want  

# How to run  
The example produses 2 executables per os:  
* The game  
* The headless server  
## Server  
A. Run the game with the `--host` command-line argument  
B. Run the headless server (use the `*.console.exe` to automaticly launch a terminal)  

You are now hosting a server  
## Client  
1. Run the game  
2. Paste the ip/hostname of the server into the `Address:` field  
3. Click `Join`
